	<h2>Website Comparison</h2>
	
	<h3 id="successful">A Successful Website</h3>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.vogue.com">Vogue</a> is a relatively successful fashion website. As you enter the website, you always first see the huge logo of “VOGUE” on the top, which visually emphasizes its identity just like what they do on their actual magazine cover. The navigation on the top is pretty clear and concisely categorized. Everything is classified into seven categories. The user can easily find the content as they want through each topic. The efficiency of performing the task can be achieved in just a minute. When you scroll down, the navigation will remain on top of the page, so that you can leave the page anytime without having to go back. Besides the easy navigation on the landing page, the remaining content is concisely edited as well, such as the highlights from different categories. You can grasp the main information quickly. Under that section, it is the “Latest News” updated on a daily basis. The articles are listed in the order of time, which they are being posted. Everything on this page is easy to follow and understand. The overall layout is right to the point: as simple as each picture followed by a title. Excess information will distract the user and make him/her lose the track of what is being displayed. Vogue does this well that your eyes are guided through the info while you go, and you don’t feel overwhelmed.

	<h3 id="less-successful">A Less Successful Website</h3>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By comparison with Vogue, 
	<a href="http://wwd.com/#">WWD</a>  is a less successful website. With the same elements I am looking at, first of all is the navigation at the top. WWD has almost doubled the number of categories Vogue has, which is 14. They are unable to be listed at once that you have to roll over the ellipsis at the end to see what the rest are. When you first enter the website, you don’t know where to look at, because there are too much information squeezed in this space. The font size of the navigation is not able to catch my attention. The overall design just decreased the learnability of the user at the first sight. Scrolling down the website, there are three columns of content. They appear at once and share the space almost evenly. The user just loses patience to figure out what they are respectively. It is really hard for users to remember the site’s construction and in order to use it efficiently. They will feel frustrated when they click on tabs several time and still can’t find the right information. Besides, the variety of the font sizes and thickness will worsen the experience. Everything on this page should be in an organized layout and the elements should work well together, so that the user can easily handle it.
